#Tic-Tac-Toe React tutorial

This is a quick react tutorial I did to make my first application using create-react-app.

To run the application download the code and run npm start.

The tutorial can be found at https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
